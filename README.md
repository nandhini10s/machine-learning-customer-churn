BANK CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION

This project predicts the customer churn using various machine learning models like Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbor, SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes and Neural Network. 

LIBRARIES USED- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, Tensorflow 

AIM OF THE MODEL:
Identify and visualize which factors contribute to customer churn
Build various prediction models and choosing the optimum model which provides highest accuracy and a descent precision and recall on customer churn rate.

CONTENT OF THE KERNEL:
The Jupyter Notebook contains EDA, descriptive statistics, correlation, data visualization, data preprocessing, train test split, predictions with ML models, evaluation through accuracy score, confusion matrix and classification report.

INFERENCE:
By comparing the performance of all the ML models, we can come to a conclusion that the best model which gives the highest accuracy and a descent precision and recall is Random Forest with an accuracy score of 86.55%, precision (on 1) of 0.76 and recall (on 1) of 0.46.
